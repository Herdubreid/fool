# Rules of Fool

A round of fool is played by three players and is based on each player must choose one of four game types -- or "say" (translating directly from Icelandic here).  
Each player takes turn dealing with the first four cards put aside for "manni".  A set four cards is then dealt around until the deck is finished, with each player ending up with 16 cards.

The player on the left hand of the dealer is the "sayer" and gets to choose the game to play.  Once he has made the choice, he can option to exchange four of his cards for the "manni".

The four games to choose from are:

### Grand
A plain game where the highest card rules (ace high).

### Spade
The highest card rules with spade as trump.

### Color
The highest card rules with any of the non-spade suits as trump -- chosen by the sayer.

### Nolo
Avoid taking tricks (ace low).

Once the game is finished the sayer deals and the player on his left side becomes the sayer.  
Each game is played only once and the round is finished when all player have played all four games.

Unlike most card games, there is no winner.  Only a loser, the Fool of the game.
